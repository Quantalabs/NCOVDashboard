### This project has been archived
The NYTimes closed their dataset recently. [The Biden Administration ended their covid team](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/22/biden-disband-covid-team/) and I've decided that it's kind of useless to continue maintaining the project. (As of right now) the code works okay, so please fork it and run your own instance.

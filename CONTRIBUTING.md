# Contributing

Welcome to the Contributing Guidelines!

## Issues

Follow the issue template based on what you are submitting (eg. Bugs uses Bug template, Feature uses Feature template, etc.). Next, make sure that all fields are filled out.

## PR's 

There are two different types of PRs you might submit.

### Bug Fixes

This is pretty simple. Simply fix the bug (and make sure it's fixed) and then submit the PR. Make sure you didn't create any additional bugs, and tested it.

### Feature addition

If you're adding a new country, then make sure that:

1. You're source is reliable, I'd highly suggest John Hopkins or Worldometers
2. You have enough data. Simply having the amount of cases and deaths isn't enough.
3. All workflows pass, if you have a bug which you can't fix, post it on Stack Overflow! You can get answers quick!
4. You've created a new directory for the country, like the [`/us`](https://github.com/Quantalabs/NCOVDashboard/tree/main/us) directory.

You can then submit your PR to the repo, and it'll be merged ASAP.

## Other info

Make sure to follow the Code Of Conduct no matter what, with an issue or PR, and submit an issue if you see something that you think shouldn't be done.
